//! This is a thin wrapper around the libsoxr C API, cribbed from 
//!
//! The documentation for this api namespace was copied from
//! [`soxr.h`](https://sourceforge.net/p/soxr/code/ci/master/tree/src/soxr.h) of libsoxr
//!
//! # API conventions
//!
//! Buffer lengths (and occupancies) are expressed as the number of contained
//! samples per channel.
//!
//! Parameter names for buffer lengths have the suffix `len'.
//!
//! A single-character `i' or 'o' is often used in names to give context as
//! input or output (e.g. ilen, olen).
